# Never enable 2-factor authentication for accounts you that actually care about

## TL;DR I lost my phone that had all my 2FA codes and I didn't have backup codes for some of them.  So sue me.

We live in the real world, where people make mistakes.  And, sometimes, we need some help to fix them.  About five years ago, I (regretfully) decided to enable 2FA on my Uber account.  First mistake.  Last mistake (I wish).  The second mistake I made was losing the phone that had all my Google Authenticator codes.  That sucked, but it was fine because I had all my backups codes.  Except one: Uber.  Somehow I never copied or recorded my Uber backup codes.


OK, I'll just email their support for help.  But I quickly ran into the problem: Uber's support is automated bot useless garbage.  


### First email
> I got a new phone and can no longer use my old Google Authenticator app to log in using 2 step authentication and I don't have backup codes. And I don't see the option in the app to receive a code via SMS. I need to have 2FA disabled on my account so that I can log in and set up my new Google Authenticator app.

This goes on and on for days and days.  I send an email, re-phrase it slightly, express the dire importance.  But nothing.  I get bots.

I bet if I said the word "rape" or "assault" then I would have gotten an actual human to look at my emails.

No, I'm not going to go that way.  I just use Lyft and yellow cabs now.
